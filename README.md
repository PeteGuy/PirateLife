# PirateLife

This is a video game developped using OpenGL, you play a pirate ship looking for treasures to improve your ship.

The goal of this project was to use a codebase provided by a teacher to develop a video game that uses 3D graphics rendered with openGL. 

This project allowed me to get a practical understing of openGL and graphics rendering in general in C++. I also got to test a physics engine I was developping on my free time. I also learnt the way shaders work and got to make my own shader using glsl.
This project does not use any game engine or graphics library.

# Install
Right now the only way to use this project is through visual studio. Simply get the code, build and run.

# Credits
- The physics part of the project use an early version of a physics engine based on Randy Gaul blog post.
- The code for 3D objects, shaders and string processing was a base code given by the teachers, some parts were modified following the needs of the project.
